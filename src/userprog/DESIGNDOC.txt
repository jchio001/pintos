>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

Using the sample skeleton code given to us, we use the exec_helper struct
to organize the arguments and pass them to process_execute.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok() is not implemented because it is not thread safe. strtok() stores
the location where the last token was found internally. When there's
2 threads calling strtok(), there is a possibility that one of the threads
will end up using the last token held by the other thread, which is not
correct.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name

-For argument parsing, we will be using shell allocated memory versus
the kernel. If this memory runs out, something really bad won't happen
compared to if we used the kernal instead (if we're out of memory in 
the kernel, the system will probably crash).

-We are able to check the vailidity of our arguments before the kernel is
given control.

			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

Each open file per process has a unique fd associated with it, and each
process has its own file descriptor counter, which is incremented 
whenever a file is opened. Because the fd counter is unique to a process,
file descriptors are only unique within a process.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room
>> for improvement in these numbers, and how much?

For both of these cases, we would need 2 calls at worst, as the byte
distribution will be split into at most 2 pages.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

When we give a process a PID, it will go through a list of child 
processes for that specific PID. If there is no child with that
PID or if the child is already waiting, we will return -1. If this
is not the case, then the current process will wait until the child
process exit (we will need some sort of identifier to say that we are
waiting a specific child process). Once the child process exists, we
will obtain it's exit status, remove the child from the parent
process's list of children, and return the exit status.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

When exec is invoked by a process, we will create a child process and 
put it into its list of children. The children will have a load
variable, and that will be set to signify that the child has not
finished loading. We will also have a sempahore to be downed to
ensure that only 1 process will be loading at a time. Once we have
completed loading this child process, we will change this load variable
to signify if we have succeeded or failed our loading. The parent process
will now be able to check the load value, and it will return -1 if the
value reflects a failure.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

It was the only method we were able to think of at the time; there is not
enough time and knowledge given for us to consider anything else.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

As of now, we are thinking of just leaving it alone due to the fact that
a process will only contain 1 thread. The advantage of this is that we
can leave it alone and be fine, but if we were to do this in a multi-
threaded-system, it will obviously fail.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
